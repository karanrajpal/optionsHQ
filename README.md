# optionsHQ

An app to view your options trading data.

The data is fetched from SnapTrade API.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Adding Shadcn components
Shadcn lets you add components that you want to use one-by-one instead of installing all the packages. The code is then installed into the `components/ui` folder as opposed to `node_modules` and you can import it from anywhere.

See [this link](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/input) for how to add an `Input` component

### PWA Icons
Update app icons in `public/` in place of `sample-192x192.png` and `sample-512x512.png` and then update `manifest.ts` with the new icons.

### Lucide Icons
Icons are sourced from https://lucide.dev/icons/

### Framer Motion
Framer Motion for React allows you to introduce animations, transitions and motion
Refer to [this link](https://blog.stackademic.com/next-js-13-framer-motion-page-transitions-b2d58658410a) as an example and the [official docs](https://examples.motion.dev/)
